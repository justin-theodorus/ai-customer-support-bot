The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans.

      "chunk_text": "Question: How is interest calculated on the Aven account?\n\nAnswer: Interest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type. - For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase. - For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed. - Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation. In addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal. If an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.",

      "chunk_text": "Question: How much am I covered for with Debt Protection?\n\nAnswer: Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? Debt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence. As an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining. Please note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.",
